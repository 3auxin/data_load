maybe you'll be lucky , and there'll be a power outage during your screening so you can get your money back .	0
the characterizations and dialogue lack depth or complexity , with the ironic exception of scooter .	0
this film was made by and for those folks who collect the serial killer cards and are fascinated by the mere suggestion of serial killers . for the rest of us , sitting through dahmer's two hours amounts to little more than punishment .	0
narc can only remind us of brilliant crime dramas without becoming one itself .	0
somewhere inside the mess that is world traveler , there is a mediocre movie trying to get out .	0
a tedious parable about honesty and good sportsmanship .	0
its strengths and weaknesses play off each other virtually to a stand-off , with the unfortunate trump card being the dreary mid-section of the film .	0
an artful yet depressing film that makes a melodramatic mountain out of the molehill of a missing bike .	0
the movie's ultimate point -- that everyone should be themselves -- is trite , but the screenwriter and director michel gondry restate it to the point of ridiculousness .	0
a glossy knock-off of a b-movie revenge flick .	0
. . . expands the horizons of boredom to the point of collapse , turning into a black hole of dullness , from which no interesting concept can escape .	0
it's just plain boring .	0
sad nonsense , this . but not without cheesy fun factor .	0
one of those decades-spanning historical epics that strives to be intimate and socially encompassing but fails to do justice to either effort in three hours of screen time .	0
really dumb but occasionally really funny .	0
the movie wavers between hallmark card sentimentality and goofy , life-affirming moments straight out of a cellular phone commercial .	0
a half-assed film .	0
the director's many dodges and turns add up to little more than a screenful of gamesmanship that's low on both suspense and payoff .	0
while the transgressive trappings ( especially the frank sex scenes ) ensure that the film is never dull , rodrigues's beast-within metaphor is ultimately rather silly and overwrought , making the ambiguous ending seem goofy rather than provocative .	0
the satire is unfocused , while the story goes nowhere .	0
they threw loads of money at an idea that should've been so much more even if it was only made for teenage boys and wrestling fans .	0
it's mired in a shabby script that piles layer upon layer of action man cliché atop wooden dialogue and a shifting tone that falls far short of the peculiarly moral amorality of [woo's] best work .	0
reyes' directorial debut has good things to offer , but ultimately it's undone by a sloppy script	0
if you're over 25 , have an iq over 90 , and have a driver's license , you should be able to find better entertainment .	0
the darker elements of misogyny and unprovoked violence suffocate the illumination created by the two daughters and the sparse instances of humor meant to shine through the gloomy film noir veil .	0
. . . the picture's cleverness is ironically muted by the very people who are intended to make it shine .	0
never does " lilo & stitch " reach the emotion or timelessness of disney's great past , or even that of more recent successes such as " mulan " or " tarzan . "	0
one of those so-so films that could have been much better .	0
crossroads feels like a teenybopper ed wood film , replete with the pubescent scandalous innuendo and the high-strung but flaccid drama .	0
fails to satisfactorily exploit its gender politics , genre thrills or inherent humor .	0
interview with the assassin is structured less as a documentary and more as a found relic , and as such the film has a difficult time shaking its blair witch project real-time roots .	0
cacoyannis' vision is far less mature , interpreting the play as a call for pity and sympathy for anachronistic phantasms haunting the imagined glory of their own pasts .	0
it has more in common with a fireworks display than a movie , which normally is expected to have characters and a storyline .	0
it appears to have been made by people to whom the idea of narrative logic or cohesion is an entirely foreign concept .	0
less a heartfelt appeal for the handicapped than a nice belgian waffle .	0
it's not helpful to listen to extremist name-calling , regardless of whether you think kissinger was a calculating fiend or just a slippery self-promoter .	0
abandon spends 90 minutes trying figure out whether or not some cocky pseudo-intellectual kid has intentionally left college or was killed . the only problem is that , by the end , no one in the audience or the film seems to really care .	0
no such thing is sort of a minimalist beauty and the beast , but in this case the beast should definitely get top billing . robert john burke as the monster horns in and steals the show .	0
due to stodgy , soap opera-ish dialogue , the rest of the cast comes across as stick figures reading lines from a teleprompter .	0
[t]he film is never sure to make a clear point – even if it seeks to rely on an ambiguous presentation .	0
while it may not add up to the sum of its parts , holofcener's film offers just enough insight to keep it from being simpleminded , and the ensemble cast is engaging enough to keep you from shifting in your chair too often .	0
an overwrought taiwanese soaper about three people and their mixed-up relationship .	0
nobody seems to have cared much about any aspect of it , from its cheesy screenplay to the grayish quality of its lighting to its last-minute , haphazard theatrical release .	0
a thoroughly awful movie--dumb , narratively chaotic , visually sloppy . . . a weird amalgam of 'the thing' and a geriatric 'scream . '	0
. . . another example of how sandler is losing his touch .	0
nothing sticks , really , except a lingering creepiness one feels from being dragged through a sad , sordid universe of guns , drugs , avarice and damaged dreams .	0
what goes on for the 110 minutes of " panic room " is a battle of witlessness between a not-so-bright mother and daughter and an even less capable trio of criminals .	0
the plot's contrivances are uncomfortably strained .	0
guilty of the worst sin of attributable to a movie like this : it's not scary in the slightest .	0
schnieder bounces around with limp wrists , wearing tight tummy tops and hip huggers , twirling his hair on his finger and assuming that's enough to sustain laughs . . .	0
its simplicity puts an exclamation point on the fact that this isn't something to be taken seriously , but it also wrecks any chance of the movie rising above similar fare .	0
by the final whistle you're convinced that this mean machine was a decent tv outing that just doesn't have big screen magic .	0
to say that this vapid vehicle is downright doltish and uneventful is just as obvious as telling a country skunk that he has severe body odor .	0
a film of empty , fetishistic violence in which murder is casual and fun .	0
pretend it's a werewolf itself by avoiding eye contact and walking slowly away . it's fun , but it's a real howler .	0
some fine acting , but ultimately a movie with no reason for being .	0
it's difficult to feel anything much while watching this movie , beyond mild disturbance or detached pleasure at the acting .	0
a waterlogged version of 'fatal attraction' for the teeny-bopper set . . . a sad , soggy potboiler that wastes the talents of its attractive young leads .	0
it tells its story in a flat manner and leaves you with the impression that you should have gotten more out of it than you did .	0
sweet gentle jesus , did the screenwriters just do a cut-and-paste of every bad action-movie line in history ?	0
it's not the worst comedy of the year , but it certainly won't win any honors .	0
this is for the most part a useless movie , even with a great director at the helm .	0
a loud , witless mess that has none of the charm and little of the intrigue from the tv series .	0
even on its own ludicrous terms , the sum of all fears generates little narrative momentum , and invites unflattering comparisons to other installments in the ryan series .	0
though it inspires some ( out-of-field ) creative thought , the film is -- to its own detriment -- much more a cinematic collage than a polemical tract .	0
as predictable as the outcome of a globetrotters-generals game , juwanna mann is even more ludicrous than you'd expect from the guy-in-a-dress genre , and a personal low for everyone involved .	0
sinks into the usual cafeteria goulash of fart jokes , masturbation jokes , and racist japanese jokes .	0
where tom green stages his gags as assaults on america's knee-jerk moral sanctimony , jackass lacks aspirations of social upheaval .	0
more of an intriguing curiosity than a gripping thriller .	0
the april 2002 instalment of the american war for independence , complete with loads of cgi and bushels of violence , but not a drop of human blood .	0
contains all the substance of a twinkie -- easy to swallow , but scarcely nourishing .	0
return to neverland manages to straddle the line between another classic for the company and just another run-of-the-mill disney sequel intended for the home video market .	0
rarely does a film so graceless and devoid of merit as this one come along .	0
it's a thin notion , repetitively stretched out to feature length , awash in self-consciously flashy camera effects , droning house music and flat , flat dialogue .	0
on a certain base level , blue crush delivers what it promises , just not well enough to recommend it .	0
the colorful masseur wastes its time on mood rather than riding with the inherent absurdity of ganesh's rise up the social ladder .	0
. . . an incredibly heavy-handed , manipulative dud that feels all too familiar .	0
wimps out by going for that pg-13 rating , so the more graphic violence is mostly off-screen and the sexuality is muted .	0
trapped presents a frightening and compelling 'what if ? ' scenario that will give most parents pause . . . . then , something terrible happens .	0
madonna has made herself over so often now , there's apparently nothing left to work with , sort of like michael jackson's nose .	0
never having seen the first two films in the series , i can't compare friday after next to them , but nothing would change the fact that what we have here is a load of clams left in the broiling sun for a good three days .	0
the story is lacking any real emotional impact , and the plot is both contrived and cliched .	0
a depraved , incoherent , instantly disposable piece of hackery .	0
it's a bad action movie because there's no rooting interest and the spectacle is grotesque and boring .	0
[soderbergh] tends to place most of the psychological and philosophical material in italics rather than trust an audience's intelligence , and he creates an overall sense of brusqueness .	0
handsome and sincere but slightly awkward in its combination of entertainment and evangelical boosterism .	0
so aggressively cheery that pollyana would reach for a barf bag .	0
scooby-doo doesn't know if it wants to be a retro-refitting exercise in campy recall for older fans or a silly , nickelodeon-esque kiddie flick .	0
russell lacks the visual panache , the comic touch , and perhaps the budget of sommers's title-bout features .	0
highly uneven and inconsistent . . . margarita happy hour kinda resembles the el cheapo margaritas served within .	0
very stupid and annoying .	0
the sum of all fears pretends to be a serious exploration of nuclear terrorism , but it's really nothing more than warmed-over cold war paranoia .	0
a listless and desultory affair .	0
represents the depths to which the girls-behaving-badly film has fallen .	0
how inept is serving sara ? it makes even elizabeth hurley seem graceless and ugly .	0
jam-packed with literally bruising jokes . every five minutes or so , someone gets clocked .	0
wins my vote for 'the 2002 enemy of cinema' award .	0
any chekhov is better than no chekhov , but it would be a shame if this was your introduction to one of the greatest plays of the last 100 years .	0
helmer hudlin tries to make a hip comedy , but his dependence on slapstick defeats the possibility of creating a more darkly edged tome .	0
lazy , miserable and smug . this is one of the biggest disappointments of the year .	0
formula 51 has dulled your senses faster and deeper than any recreational drug on the market .	0
every visual joke is milked , every set-up obvious and lengthy , every punchline predictable . there's no energy .	0
apparently writer-director attal thought he need only cast himself and his movie-star wife sitting around in their drawers to justify a film .	0
after the setup , the air leaks out of the movie , flattening its momentum with about an hour to go .	0
this is a poster movie , a mediocre tribute to films like them !	0
at three hours and with very little story or character development , there is plenty of room for editing , and a much shorter cut surely would have resulted in a smoother , more focused narrative without sacrificing any of the cultural intrigue .	0
a bit too derivative to stand on its own as the psychological thriller it purports to be .	0
a crude teen-oriented variation on a theme that the playwright craig lucas explored with infinitely more grace and eloquence in his prelude to a kiss .	0
the film's darker moments become smoothed over by an overwhelming need to tender inspirational tidings , especially in the last few cloying moments .	0
if you recognize zeus ( the dog from snatch ) it will make you wish you were at home watching that movie instead of in the theater watching this one .	0
abysmally pathetic	0
this is the kind of movie that you only need to watch for about thirty seconds before you say to yourself , 'ah , yes , here we have a bad , bad , bad movie . '	0
shanghai ghetto should be applauded for finding a new angle on a tireless story , but you might want to think twice before booking passage .	0
plays like a checklist of everything rob reiner and his cast were sending up .	0
there's too much forced drama in this wildly uneven movie , about a young man's battle with his inescapable past and uncertain future in a very shapable but largely unfulfilling present .	0
it's at once laughable and compulsively watchable , in its committed dumbness .	0
all the sensuality , all the eroticism of a good vampire tale has been , pardon the pun , sucked out and replaced by goth goofiness .	0
a cross between blow and boyz n the hood , this movie strives to be more , but doesn't quite get there . good performances keep it from being a total rehash .	0
the screenplay is hugely overwritten , with tons and tons of dialogue -- most of it given to children .	0
troll the cult section of your local video store for the real deal .	0
at times , the movie looks genuinely pretty . your nightmares , on the other hand , will be anything but . not even felinni would know what to make of this italian freakshow .	0
elmo touts his drug as being 51 times stronger than coke . if you're looking for a tale of brits behaving badly , watch snatch again . it's 51 times better than this .	0
it's difficult to conceive of anyone who has reached puberty actually finding the characters in slackers or their antics amusing , let alone funny .	0
despite its promising cast of characters , big trouble remains a loosely tied series of vignettes which only prove that 'zany' doesn't necessarily mean 'funny . '	0
both shrill and soporific , and because everything is repeated five or six times , it can seem tiresomely simpleminded .	0
does not go far enough in its humor or stock ideas to stand out as particularly memorable or even all that funny .	0
neither revelatory nor truly edgy--merely crassly flamboyant and comedically labored .	0
just about everyone involved here seems to be coasting . there are a few modest laughs , but certainly no thrills .	0
fails so fundamentally on every conventional level that it achieves some kind of goofy grandeur .	0
there's a persistent theatrical sentiment and a woozy quality to the manner of the storytelling , which undercuts the devastatingly telling impact of utter loss personified in the film's simple title .	0
while howard's appreciation of brown and his writing is clearly well-meaning and sincere , the movie would be impossible to sit through were it not for the supporting cast .	0
a preposterous , prurient whodunit .	0
go , girls , right down the reality drain .	0
boasting some of the most poorly staged and lit action in memory , impostor is as close as you can get to an imitation movie .	0
can be classified as one of those 'alternate reality' movies . . . except that it would have worked so much better dealing in only one reality .	0
predictable and cloying , though brown sugar is so earnest in its yearning for the days before rap went nihilistic that it summons more spirit and bite than your average formulaic romantic quadrangle .	0
. . . unlikable , uninteresting , unfunny , and completely , utterly inept .	0
the film is so busy making reference to other films and trying to be other films that it fails to have a heart , mind or humor of its own .	0
an imponderably stilted and self-consciously arty movie .	0
muddled , melodramatic paranormal romance is an all-time low for kevin costner .	0
too clumsy in key moments . . . to make a big splash .	0
just a bunch of good actors flailing around in a caper that's neither original nor terribly funny .	0
`matrix'-style massacres erupt throughout . . . but the movie has a tougher time balancing its violence with kafka-inspired philosophy .	0
at least it's a fairly impressive debut from the director , charles stone iii .	0
it all unfolds predictably , and the adventures that happen along the way seem repetitive and designed to fill time , providing no real sense of suspense .	0
wanker goths are on the loose ! run for your lives !	0
why would anyone cast the magnificent jackie chan in a movie full of stunt doubles and special effects ?	0
a grating , emaciated flick .	0
unambitious writing emerges in the movie , using a plot that could have come from an animated-movie screenwriting textbook .	0
presents a good case while failing to provide a reason for us to care beyond the very basic dictums of human decency .	0
we have poignancy jostling against farce , thoughtful dialogue elbowed aside by one-liners , and a visual style that incorporates rotoscope animation for no apparent reason except , maybe , that it looks neat .	0
. . . unbearably lame .	0
according to the script , grant and bullock's characters are made for each other . but you'd never guess that from the performances .	0
the animation merely serves up a predictable , maudlin story that swipes heavily from bambi and the lion king , yet lacks the emotional resonance of either of those movies .	0
ararat feels like a book report	0
steve oedekerk is , alas , no woody allen .	0
a lot like the imaginary sport it projects onto the screen -- loud , violent and mindless .	0
an amalgam of the fugitive , blade runner , and total recall , only without much energy or tension .	0
the acting is amateurish , the cinematography is atrocious , the direction is clumsy , the writing is insipid and the violence is at once luridly graphic and laughably unconvincing .	0
shows that jackie chan is getting older , and that's something i would rather live in denial about	0
with miscast leads , banal dialogue and an absurdly overblown climax , killing me softly belongs firmly in the so-bad-it's-good camp .	0
alas , the black-and-white archival footage of their act showcases pretty mediocre shtick .	0
the slapstick is labored , and the bigger setpieces flat .	0
this is the kind of movie where people who have never picked a lock do so easily after a few tries and become expert fighters after a few weeks .	0
the problem with the mayhem in formula 51 is not that it's offensive , but that it's boring .	0
much of the digitally altered footage appears jagged , as if filmed directly from a television monitor , while the extensive use of stock footage quickly becomes a tiresome cliché .	0
the film never rises above a conventional , two dimension tale	0
mark wahlberg . . . may look classy in a '60s-homage pokepie hat , but as a character he's dry , dry , dry .	0
told in scattered fashion , the movie only intermittently lives up to the stories and faces and music of the men who are its subject .	0
the irony is that this film's cast is uniformly superb ; their performances could have -- should have -- been allowed to stand on their own .	0
now i can see why people thought i was too hard on " the mothman prophecies " .	0
if ever a concept came handed down from the movie gods on a silver platter , this is it . if ever such a dependable concept was botched in execution , this is it .	0
with an unusual protagonist ( a kilt-wearing jackson ) and subject matter , the improbable " formula 51 " is somewhat entertaining , but it could have been much stronger .	0
sandra bullock's best dramatic performance to date ( is ) almost enough to lift ( this ) thrill-kill cat-and-mouser . . . above its paint-by-numbers plot .	0
a feel-good movie that doesn't give you enough to feel good about .	0
adolescents will be adequately served by the movie's sophomoric blend of shenanigans and slapstick , although the more lascivious-minded might be disappointed in the relative modesty of a movie that sports a 'topless tutorial service . '	0
this mistaken-identity picture is so film-culture referential that the final product is a ghost .	0
the picture emerges as a surprisingly anemic disappointment .	0
de niro cries . you'll cry for your money back .	0
slap me , i saw this movie .	0
[the kid's] just too bratty for sympathy , and as the film grows to its finale , his little changes ring hollow .	0
behind the glitz , hollywood is sordid and disgusting . quelle surprise !	0
scherfig , who has had a successful career in tv , tackles more than she can handle .	0
just consider what new best friend does not have , beginning with the minor omission of a screenplay .	0
oscar caliber cast doesn't live up to material	0
the problems of the people in love in the time of money are hardly specific to their era . they just have problems , which are neither original nor are presented in convincing way .	0
carrying this wafer-thin movie on his nimble shoulders , chan wades through putrid writing , direction and timing with a smile that says , 'if i stay positive , maybe i can channel one of my greatest pictures , drunken master . '	0
so putrid it is not worth the price of the match that should be used to burn every print of the film .	0
in the end , the movie bogs down in insignificance , saying nothing about kennedy's assassination and revealing nothing about the pathology it pretends to investigate .	0
starts out ballsy and stylish but fails to keep it up and settles into clichés .	0
sometimes makes less sense than the bruckheimeresque american action flicks it emulates .	0
one of those films where the characters inhabit that special annex of hell where adults behave like kids , children behave like adults and everyone screams at the top of their lungs no matter what the situation .	0
there's only one way to kill michael myers for good : stop buying tickets to these movies .	0
bland but harmless .	0
'rare birds' tries to force its quirkiness upon the audience .	0
the movie is about as humorous as watching your favorite pet get buried alive .	0
resident evil is what comes from taking john carpenter's ghosts of mars and eliminating the beheadings . in other words , about as bad a film you're likely to see all year .	0
five screenwriters are credited with the cliché-laden screenplay ; it seems as if each watered down the version of the one before .	0
the whole thing comes off like a particularly amateurish episode of bewitched that takes place during spring break .	0
well made but uninvolving , bloodwork isn't a terrible movie , just a stultifyingly obvious one -- an unrewarding collar for a murder mystery .	0
so we got ten little indians meets friday the 13th by way of clean and sober , filmed on the set of carpenter's the thing and loaded with actors you're most likely to find on the next inevitable incarnation of the love boat .	0
the movie's blatant derivativeness is one reason it's so lackluster .	0
la de salma es una versión de frida superficial , preciosista y sin ningún contenido .	0
kids don't mind crappy movies as much as adults , provided there's lots of cute animals and clumsy people . 'snow dogs' has both .	0
it's almost as if it's an elaborate dare more than a full-blooded film .	0
wobbly senegalese updating of " carmen " which is best for the stunning star turn by djeinaba diop gai	0
it's the humanizing stuff that will probably sink the film for anyone who doesn't think about percentages all day long .	0
ken russell would love this . in one scene , we get a stab at soccer hooliganism , a double-barreled rip-off of quentin tarantino's climactic shootout — and meat loaf explodes .	0
bella is the picture of health with boundless energy until a few days before she dies . this is absolutely and completely ridiculous and an insult to every family whose mother has suffered through the horrible pains of a death by cancer .	0
the premise of " abandon " holds promise , . . . but its delivery is a complete mess .	0
what could have been a pointed little chiller about the frightening seductiveness of new technology loses faith in its own viability and succumbs to joyless special-effects excess .	0
a little too ponderous to work as shallow entertainment , not remotely incisive enough to qualify as drama , monsoon wedding serves mostly to whet one's appetite for the bollywood films .	0
unless bob crane is someone of particular interest to you , this film's impressive performances and adept direction aren't likely to leave a lasting impression .	0
the rock has a great presence but one battle after another is not the same as one battle followed by killer cgi effects .	0
the bottom line with nemesis is the same as it has been with all the films in the series : fans will undoubtedly enjoy it , and the uncommitted needn't waste their time on it .	0
the lousy john q all but spits out denzel washington's fine performance in the title role .	0
the whole thing feels like a ruse , a tactic to cover up the fact that the picture is constructed around a core of flimsy -- or , worse yet , nonexistent -- ideas .	0
what a stiflingly unfunny and unoriginal mess this is !	0
the film is so packed with subplots involving the various silbersteins that it feels more like the pilot episode of a tv series than a feature film .	0
opera on film is never satisfactory . the art demands live viewing . the innate theatrics that provide its thrills and extreme emotions lose their luster when flattened onscreen .	0
despite all the closed-door hanky-panky , the film is essentially juiceless .	0
it is parochial , accessible to a chosen few , standoffish to everyone else , and smugly suggests a superior moral tone is more important than filmmaking skill	0
the sweetest thing leaves an awful sour taste .	0
it's lost the politics and the social observation and become just another situation romance about a couple of saps stuck in an inarticulate screenplay .	0
terminally bland , painfully slow and needlessly confusing . . . the movie , shot on digital videotape rather than film , is frequently indecipherable .	0
as dumb and cheesy as they may be , the cartoons look almost shakespearean -- both in depth and breadth -- after watching this digital-effects-heavy , supposed family-friendly comedy .	0
aloof and lacks any real raw emotion , which is fatal for a film that relies on personal relationships .	0
a low-rent retread of the alien pictures .	0
serviceable at best , slightly less than serviceable at worst .	0
its initial excitement settles into a warmed over pastiche .	0
a big meal of cliches that the talented cast generally chokes on .	0
the story has little wit and no surprises .	0
the merchant-ivory team continues to systematically destroy everything we hold dear about cinema , only now it's begun to split up so that it can do even more damage .	0
what should have been a cutting hollywood satire is instead about as fresh as last week's issue of variety .	0
hey everybody , wanna watch a movie in which a guy dressed as a children's party clown gets violently gang-raped ? i didn't think so .	0
a little more intensity and a little less charm would have saved this film a world of hurt .	0
dense and enigmatic . . . elusive . . . stagy and stilted	0
[t]his slop doesn't even have potential as a cult film , as it's too loud to shout insults at the screen .	0
the movie's plot is almost entirely witless and inane , carrying every gag two or three times beyond its limit to sustain a laugh .	0
. . . may work as an addictive guilty pleasure but the material never overcomes its questionable satirical ambivalence . this scarlet's letter is a . . . as in aimless , arduous , and arbitrary .	0
plays like a glossy melodrama that occasionally verges on camp .	0
the central character isn't complex enough to hold our interest .	0
a modestly comic , modestly action-oriented world war ii adventure that , in terms of authenticity , is one of those films that requires the enemy to never shoot straight .	0
a puppy dog so desperate for attention it nearly breaks its little neck trying to perform entertaining tricks .	0
just about all of the film is confusing on one level or another , making ararat far more demanding than it needs to be .	0
a little less extreme than in the past , with longer exposition sequences between them , and with fewer gags to break the tedium .	0
there's a heavy stench of 'been there , done that' hanging over the film . it's everything you'd expect -- but nothing more .	0
the biggest problem with satin rouge is lilia herself . she's a cipher , played by an actress who smiles and frowns but doesn't reveal an inner life .	0
a quaint , romanticized rendering .	0
what with the incessant lounge music playing in the film's background , you may mistake love liza for an adam sandler chanukah song .	0
the movie's heavy-handed screenplay navigates a fast fade into pomposity and pretentiousness .	0
a potentially good comic premise and excellent cast are terribly wasted .	0
woody allen used to ridicule movies like hollywood ending . now he makes them .	0
she's not yet an actress , not quite a singer . . .	0
not a bad premise , but the execution is lackluster at best .	0
been there done that .	0
there is only so much baked cardboard i need to chew .	0
a movie like the guys is why film criticism can be considered work .	0
schnitzler's film has a great hook , some clever bits and well-drawn , if standard issue , characters , but is still only partly satisfying .	0
even if it made its original release date last fall , it would've reeked of a been-there , done-that sameness .	0
only two-fifths of a satisfying movie experience .	0
a loud , ugly , irritating movie without any of its satirical salvos hitting a discernible target .	0
[l]ame and unnecessary .	0
a movie version of a paint-by-numbers picture . we can tell what it is supposed to be , but can't really call it a work of art .	0
it's a brilliant , honest performance by nicholson , but the film is an agonizing bore except when the fantastic kathy bates turns up . bravado kathy !	0
. . . liotta is put in an impossible spot because his character's deceptions ultimately undo him and the believability of the entire scenario . too bad .	0
you can thank me for this . i saw juwanna mann so you don't have to .	0
unfunny and lacking any sense of commitment to or affection for its characters , the reginald hudlin comedy relies on toilet humor , ethnic slurs .	0
basically , it's pretty but dumb .	0
this romantic/comedy asks the question how much souvlaki can you take before indigestion sets in .	0
squandering his opportunity to make absurdist observations , burns gets caught up in the rush of slapstick thoroughfare .	0
there's a neat twist , subtly rendered , that could have wrapped things up at 80 minutes , but kang tacks on three or four more endings .	0
reeboir varies between a sweet smile and an angry bark , while said attempts to wear down possible pupils through repetition . it has no affect on the kurds , but it wore me down .	0
the actors improvise and scream their way around this movie directionless , lacking any of the rollicking dark humor so necessary to make this kind of idea work on screen .	0
co-writer/director jonathan parker's attempts to fashion a brazil-like , hyper-real satire fall dreadfully short .	0
if this silly little cartoon can inspire a few kids not to grow up to be greedy bastards , more power to it .	0
a superfluous sequel . . . plagued by that old familiar feeling of 'let's get this thing over with' : everyone has shown up at the appointed time and place , but visible enthusiasm is mighty hard to find .	0
if there's a heaven for bad movies , deuces wild is on its way .	0
comes off like a bad imitation of the bard .	0
what's missing in murder by numbers is any real psychological grounding for the teens' deviant behaviour . being latently gay and liking to read are hardly enough .	0
an uninspired preachy and clichéd war film .	0
horrendously amateurish filmmaking that is plainly dull and visually ugly when it isn't incomprehensible .	0

writer-director walter hill and co-writer david giler try to create characters out of the obvious cliches , but wind up using them as punching bags .	0

a really funny fifteen-minute short stretched beyond its limits to fill an almost feature-length film .	0
aside from the fact that the film idiotically uses the website feardotcom . com or the improperly hammy performance from poor stephen rea , the film gets added disdain for the fact that it is nearly impossible to look at or understand .	0
it is bad , but certainly not without merit as entertainment .	0
for its 100 minutes running time , you'll wait in vain for a movie to happen .	0
a work that lacks both a purpose and a strong pulse .	0
a faster paced family flick . upper teens may get cynical . smaller numbered kidlets will enjoy .	0

it's a road-trip drama with too many wrong turns .	0
most fish stories are a little peculiar , but this is one that should be thrown back in the river .	0
it's all gratuitous before long , as if schwentke were fulfilling a gross-out quota for an anticipated audience demographic instead of shaping the material to fit the story .	0

by halfway through this picture i was beginning to hate it , and , of course , feeling guilty for it . . . . then , miracle of miracles , the movie does a flip-flop .	0
for all the complications , it's all surprisingly predictable .	0

if deuces wild had been tweaked up a notch it would have become a camp adventure , one of those movies that's so bad it starts to become good . but it wasn't .	0
for a film about action , ultimate x is the gabbiest giant-screen movie ever , bogging down in a barrage of hype .	0
. . . a low rate annie featuring some kid who can't act , only echoes of jordan , and weirdo actor crispin glover screwing things up old school .	0
it might not be 1970s animation , but everything else about it is straight from the saturday morning cartoons – a retread story , bad writing , and the same old silliness .	0
the picture seems uncertain whether it wants to be an acidic all-male all about eve or a lush , swooning melodrama in the intermezzo strain .	0
tends to plod .	0
a nearly 21/2 hours , the film is way too indulgent .	0
gorgeous to look at but insufferably tedious and turgid . . . a curiously constricted epic .	0
it looks much more like a cartoon in the end than the simpsons ever has .	0
with a tighter editorial process and firmer direction this material could work , especially since the actresses in the lead roles are all more than competent , but as is , personal velocity seems to be idling in neutral .	0
doesn't really add up to much .	0
it's better suited for the history or biography channel , but there's no arguing the tone of the movie - it leaves a bad taste in your mouth and questions on your mind .	0
an entertainment so in love with its overinflated mythology that it no longer recognizes the needs of moviegoers for real characters and compelling plots .	0
a prolonged extrusion of psychopathic pulp .	0
borrows from other movies like it in the most ordinary and obvious fashion .	0
it's surprisingly bland despite the heavy doses of weird performances and direction .	0
a chilly , remote , emotionally distant piece . . . so dull that its tagline should be : 'in space , no one can hear you snore . '	0
the characters seem one-dimensional , and the film is superficial and will probably be of interest primarily to its target audience .	0
sorvino makes the princess seem smug and cartoonish , and the film only really comes alive when poor hermocrates and leontine pathetically compare notes about their budding amours .	0
it's like a drive-by . you can drive right by it without noticing anything special , save for a few comic turns , intended and otherwise .	0
everything -- even life on an aircraft carrier -- is sentimentalized .	0
this would-be 'james bond for the extreme generation' pic is one big , dumb action movie . stress 'dumb . '	0
the movie has generic virtues , and despite a lot of involved talent , seems done by the numbers .	0
when your subject is illusion versus reality , shouldn't the reality seem at least passably real ?	0
it's a terrible movie in every regard , and utterly painful to watch .	0
this is rote spookiness , with nary an original idea ( or role , or edit , or score , or anything , really ) in sight , and the whole of the proceedings beg the question 'why ? '	0
a fan film that for the uninitiated plays better on video with the sound turned down .	0
too infuriatingly quirky and taken with its own style .	0
there's a whole heap of nothing at the core of this slight coming-of-age/coming-out tale .	0
as much as i laughed throughout the movie , i cannot mount a cogent defense of the film as entertainment , or even performance art , although the movie does leave you marveling at these guys' superhuman capacity to withstand pain .	0
the type of dumbed-down exercise in stereotypes that gives the [teen comedy] genre a bad name .	0
distinctly sub-par . . . more likely to drown a viewer in boredom than to send any shivers down his spine .	0
plays like a bad blend of an overripe episode of tv's dawson's creek and a recycled and dumbed-down version of love story .	0
unless you come in to the film with a skateboard under your arm , you're going to feel like you weren't invited to the party .	0
when the casting call for this movie went out , it must have read 'seeking anyone with acting ambition but no sense of pride or shame . '	0
just isn't as weird as it ought to be .	0
a " home alone " film that is staged like " rosemary's baby , " but is not as well-conceived as either of those films .	0
[siegel] and co-writers lisa bazadona and grace woodard have relied too much on convention in creating the characters who surround frankie .	0
no film could possibly be more contemptuous of the single female population .	0
`hey arnold ! ' has some visual wit . . . but little imagination elsewhere .	0
they're going through the motions , but the zip is gone .	0
a sluggish pace and lack of genuine narrative hem the movie in every bit as much as life hems in the spirits of these young women .	0
a low-budget affair , tadpole was shot on digital video , and the images often look smeary and blurry , to the point of distraction . then again , in a better movie , you might not have noticed .	0
it's mindless junk like this that makes you appreciate original romantic comedies like punch-drunk love .	0
the movie is like a year late for tapping into our reality tv obsession , and even tardier for exploiting the novelty of the " webcast . "	0
tale will be all too familiar for anyone who's seen george roy hill's 1973 film , " the sting . "	0
gets the look and the period trappings right , but it otherwise drowns in a sea of visual and verbal clichés .	0
it's hard to quibble with a flick boasting this many genuine cackles , but notorious c . h . o . still feels like a promising work-in-progress .	0

a late-night cable sexploitation romp masquerading as a thriller about the ruthless social order that governs college cliques .	0
falls short in explaining the music and its roots .	0
never inspires more than an interested detachment .	0
what might have emerged as hilarious lunacy in the hands of woody allen or mel brooks ( at least during their '70s heyday ) comes across as lame and sophomoric in this debut indie feature .	0
despite slick production values and director roger michell's tick-tock pacing , the final effect is like having two guys yelling in your face for two hours .	0
pretty much sucks , but has a funny moment or two .	0
they do a good job of painting this family dynamic for the audience but they tried to squeeze too many elements into the film .	0
a supernatural mystery that doesn't know whether it wants to be a suspenseful horror movie or a weepy melodrama . it ends up being neither , and fails at both endeavors .	0
two badly interlocked stories drowned by all too clever complexity .	0
it is so earnest , so overwrought and so wildly implausible that it begs to be parodied .	0
these are textbook lives of quiet desperation .	0
swimfan , like fatal attraction , eventually goes overboard with a loony melodramatic denouement in which a high school swimming pool substitutes for a bathtub .	0
claims to sort the bad guys from the good , which is its essential problem .	0
purposefully shocking in its eroticized gore , if unintentionally dull in its lack of poetic frissons .	0
feels like pieces a bunch of other , better movies slapped together .	0
almost everything about the film is unsettling , from the preposterous hairpiece worn by lai's villainous father to the endless action sequences .	0
writer-director randall wallace has bitten off more than he or anyone else could chew , and his movie veers like a drunken driver through heavy traffic .	0
it follows the blair witch formula for an hour , in which we're told something creepy and vague is in the works , and then it goes awry in the final 30 minutes .	0

god is great , the movie's not .	0
like a three-ring circus , there are side stories aplenty -- none of them memorable .	0
when in doubt , the film ratchets up the stirring soundtrack , throws in a fish-out-of-water gag and lets the cliched dialogue rip . or else a doggie winks .	0
a 'girls gone wild' video for the boho art-house crowd , the burning sensation isn't a definitive counter-cultural document -- its makers aren't removed and inquisitive enough for that .	0
as original and insightful as last week's episode of behind the music .	0
plays like john le carré with a couple of burnt-out cylinders .	0
you may be galled that you've wasted nearly two hours of your own precious life with this silly little puddle of a movie .	0
it's neither as sappy as big daddy nor as anarchic as happy gilmore or the waterboy , but it has its moments .	0
despite the surface attractions -- conrad l . hall's cinematography will likely be nominated for an oscar next year -- there's something impressive and yet lacking about everything .	0
a smug and convoluted action-comedy that doesn't allow an earnest moment to pass without reminding audiences that it's only a movie .	0
[crystal and de niro] manage to squeeze out some good laughs but not enough to make this silly con job sing .	0

the christ allegory doesn't work because there is no foundation for it	0
go for la salle's performance , and make do as best you can with a stuttering script .	0

tries too hard to be funny in a way that's too loud , too goofy and too short of an attention span .	0
i didn't find much fascination in the swinging . what they're doing is a matter of plumbing arrangements and mind games , of no erotic or sensuous charge . but that they are doing it is thought-provoking .	0
the acting is just fine , but there's not enough substance here to sustain interest for the full 90 minutes , especially with the weak payoff .	0
after collateral damage , you might imagine that most every aggrieved father cliché has been unturned . but no .	0
ultimately the , yes , snail-like pacing and lack of thematic resonance make the film more silly than scary , like some sort of martha stewart decorating program run amok .	0
releasing a film with the word 'dog' in its title in january lends itself to easy jokes and insults , and snow dogs deserves every single one of them .	0
tedious norwegian offering which somehow snagged an oscar nomination .	0
it was a dark and stormy night . . .	0

most of the dialogue made me want to pack raw dough in my ears .	0
costner's warm-milk persona is just as ill-fitting as shadyac's perfunctory directing chops , and some of the more overtly silly dialogue would sink laurence olivier .	0

no matter how you slice it , mark wahlberg and thandie newton are not hepburn and grant , two cinematic icons with chemistry galore .	0
godard's ode to tackling life's wonderment is a rambling and incoherent manifesto about the vagueness of topical excess . . . in praise of love remains a ponderous and pretentious endeavor that's unfocused and tediously exasperating .	0
humorless , self-conscious art drivel , made without a glimmer of intelligence or invention .	0
the movie's progression into rambling incoherence gives new meaning to the phrase 'fatal script error . '	0

meandering and glacially paced , and often just plain dull .	0
a disaster of a drama , saved only by its winged assailants .	0
a road trip that will get you thinking , 'are we there yet ? '	0
director elie chouraqui , who co-wrote the script , catches the chaotic horror of war , but why bother if you're going to subjugate truth to the tear-jerking demands of soap opera ?	0

a lame comedy .	0
depressingly thin and exhaustingly contrived . only masochistic moviegoers need apply .	0

the problem , amazingly enough , is the screenplay .	0
it's a frankenstein-monster of a film that doesn't know what it wants to be .	0
upper west sidey exercise in narcissism and self-congratulation disguised as a tribute .	0
on its icy face , the new film is a subzero version of monsters , inc . , without the latter's imagination , visual charm or texture .	0
i can't say this enough : this movie is about an adult male dressed in pink jammies .	0
it's a mindless action flick with a twist -- far better suited to video-viewing than the multiplex .	0

this is a heartfelt story . . . it just isn't a very involving one .	0
these self-styled athletes have banged their brains into the ground so frequently and furiously , their capacity to explain themselves has gone the same way as their natural instinct for self-preservation .	0
the fact that the 'best part' of the movie comes from a 60-second homage to one of demme's good films doesn't bode well for the rest of it .	0
richard pryor mined his personal horrors and came up with a treasure chest of material , but lawrence gives us mostly fool's gold .	0

mctiernan's remake may be lighter on its feet -- the sober-minded original was as graceful as a tap-dancing rhino -- but it is just as boring and as obvious .	0

like its title character , esther kahn is unusual but unfortunately also irritating .	0
the star who helped give a spark to " chasing amy " and " changing lanes " falls flat as thinking man cia agent jack ryan in this summer's new action film , " the sum of all fears . "	0
a summary of the plot doesn't quite do justice to the awfulness of the movie , for that comes through all too painfully in the execution .	0
every conceivable mistake a director could make in filming opera has been perpetrated here .	0
snoots will no doubt rally to its cause , trotting out threadbare standbys like 'masterpiece' and 'triumph' and all that malarkey , but rarely does an established filmmaker so ardently waste viewers' time with a gobbler like this .	0
[the film's] taste for " shock humor " will wear thin on all but those weaned on the comedy of tom green and the farrelly brothers .	0
any enjoyment will be hinge from a personal threshold of watching sad but endearing characters do extremely unconventional things .	0
if legendary shlockmeister ed wood had ever made a movie about a vampire , it probably would look a lot like this alarming production , adapted from anne rice's novel the vampire chronicles .	0
hardly a nuanced portrait of a young woman's breakdown , the film nevertheless works up a few scares .	0
interminably bleak , to say nothing of boring .	0
things really get weird , though not particularly scary : the movie is all portent and no content .	0
it's difficult to discern if this is a crazy work of disturbed genius or merely 90 minutes of post-adolescent electra rebellion .	0

the camera whirls ! the camera twirls ! oh , look at that clever angle ! wow , a jump cut !	0
demme finally succeeds in diminishing his stature from oscar-winning master to lowly studio hack .	0
the action scenes have all the suspense of a 20-car pileup , while the plot holes are big enough for a train car to drive through -- if kaos hadn't blown them all up .	0
it almost feels as if the movie is more interested in entertaining itself than in amusing us .	0
it puts washington , as honest working man john q . archibald , on a pedestal , then keeps lifting the pedestal higher .	0

far more enjoyable than its predecessor .	0
[gayton's script] telegraphs every discovery and layers on the gloss of convenience .	0
full frontal , which opens today nationwide , could almost be classified as a movie-industry satire , but it lacks the generous inclusiveness that is the genre's definitive , if disingenuous , feature .	0
a ragbag of cliches .	0
this rough trade punch-and-judy act didn't play well then and it plays worse now .	0
a reality-snubbing hodgepodge .	0
the three leads produce adequate performances , but what's missing from this material is any depth of feeling .	0
it's possible that something hip and transgressive was being attempted here that stubbornly refused to gel , but the result is more puzzling than unsettling .	0
this painfully unfunny farce traffics in tired stereotypes and encumbers itself with complications . . . that have no bearing on the story .	0
short and sweet , but also more than anything else slight… tadpole pulls back from the consequences of its own actions and revelations .	0

collateral damage offers formula payback and the big payoff , but the explosions tend to simply hit their marks , pyro-correctly .	0
the plan to make enough into ‘an inspiring tale of survival wrapped in the heart-pounding suspense of a stylish psychological thriller' has flopped as surely as a soufflé gone wrong .	0
instead of letting the laughs come as they may , lawrence unleashes his trademark misogyny -- er , comedy -- like a human volcano or an overflowing septic tank , take your pick .	0

even by the intentionally low standards of frat-boy humor , sorority boys is a bowser .	0
one well-timed explosion in a movie can be a knockout , but a hundred of them can be numbing . proof of this is ballistic : ecks vs . sever .	0
halfway through , however , having sucked dry the undead action flick formula , blade ii mutates into a gross-out monster movie with effects that are more silly than scary .	0
weighted down with slow , uninvolving storytelling and flat acting .	0

'wouldn't it be nice if all guys got a taste of what it's like on the other side of the bra ? '	0
the movie is essentially a series of fleetingly interesting actors' moments .	0
most of the information has already appeared in one forum or another and , no matter how broomfield dresses it up , it tends to speculation , conspiracy theories or , at best , circumstantial evidence .	0

comes across as a fairly weak retooling .	0
the lousy lead performances . . . keep the movie from ever reaching the comic heights it obviously desired .	0
its and pieces of the hot chick are so hilarious , and schneider's performance is so fine , it's a real shame that so much of the movie -- again , as in the animal -- is a slapdash mess .	0
[creates] the worst kind of mythologizing , the kind that sacrifices real heroism and abject suffering for melodrama .	0
the movie resolutely avoids all the comic possibilities of its situation , and becomes one more dumb high school comedy about sex gags and prom dates .	0
earnest and heartfelt but undernourished and plodding .	0
a sugar-coated rocky whose valuable messages are forgotten 10 minutes after the last trombone honks .	0
romanek keeps adding flourishes -- artsy fantasy sequences -- that simply feel wrong . they cheapen the overall effect .	0
has all the complexity and realistic human behavior of an episode of general hospital .	0
an acceptable way to pass a little over an hour with moviegoers ages 8-10 , but it's unlikely to inspire anything more than a visit to mcdonald's , let alone some savvy street activism .	0
[allen's] been making piffle for a long while , and hollywood ending may be his way of saying that piffle is all that the airhead movie business deserves from him right now .	0
an exercise in cynicism every bit as ugly as the shabby digital photography and muddy sound .	0
mildly amusing .	0
not good enough to pass for a litmus test of the generation gap and not bad enough to repulse any generation of its fans .	0
the movie is silly beyond comprehension , and even if it weren't silly , it would still be beyond comprehension .	0
watchable up until the point where the situations and the dialogue spin hopelessly out of control -- that is to say , when carol kane appears on the screen .	0
the scriptwriters are no less a menace to society than the film's characters .	0
fairly run-of-the-mill .	0
merchant hasn't directed this movie so much as produced it -- like sausage .	0
the film has a nearly terminal case of the cutes , and it's neither as funny nor as charming as it thinks it is .	0
more a gunfest than a rock concert .	0
it's a frightful vanity film that , no doubt , pays off what debt miramax felt they owed to benigni .	0
a muddy psychological thriller rife with miscalculations . it makes me say the obvious : abandon all hope of a good movie ye who enter here .	0
mildly entertaining .	0
it's not original enough .	0
a listless sci-fi comedy in which eddie murphy deploys two guises and elaborate futuristic sets to no particularly memorable effect .	0
terrible .	0
little more than a super-sized infomercial for the cable-sports channel and its summer x games .	0
degenerates into hogwash .	0
a generic bloodbath that often becomes laughably unbearable when it isn't merely offensive .	0
julie davis is the kathie lee gifford of film directors , sadly proving once again ego doesn't always go hand in hand with talent .	0
an unholy mess , driven by the pathetic idea that if you shoot something on crummy-looking videotape , it must be labelled 'hip' , 'innovative' and 'realistic' .	0
the story's pathetic and the gags are puerile .	0

so bland and utterly forgettable that it might as well have been titled generic jennifer lopez romantic comedy .	0
i was sent a copyof this film to review on dvd . for free . i still want my money back .	0
it plods along methodically , somehow under the assumption that its " dead wife communicating from beyond the grave " framework is even remotely new or interesting .	0
it's hard to believe that a relationship like holly and marina's could survive the hothouse emotions of teendom , and its longevity gets more inexplicable as the characterizations turn more crassly reductive .	0
all too familiar . . . basically the sort of cautionary tale that was old when 'angels with dirty faces' appeared in 1938 .	0
…passable enough for a shoot-out in the o . k . court house of life type of flick . strictly middle of the road .	0
although purportedly a study in modern alienation , it's really little more than a particularly slanted , gay s/m fantasy , enervating and deadeningly drawn-out .	0
after the first 10 minutes , which is worth seeing , the movie sinks into an abyss of clichés , depression and bad alternative music .	0
no one can doubt the filmmakers' motives , but the guys still feels counterproductive .	0

well-meaning to a fault , antwone fisher manages the dubious feat of turning one man's triumph of will into everyman's romance comedy .	0
seemingly disgusted with the lazy material and the finished product's unshapely look , director fisher stevens inexplicably dips key moments from the film in waking life water colors .	0
formula 51 promises a new kind of high but delivers the same old bad trip .	0
everything that was right about blade is wrong in its sequel .	0
a few energetic stunt sequences briefly enliven the film , but the wheezing terrorist subplot hasn't the stamina for the 100-minute running time , and the protagonists' bohemian boorishness mars the spirit of good clean fun .	0
the film was produced by jerry bruckheimer and directed by joel schumacher , and reflects the worst of their shallow styles : wildly overproduced , inadequately motivated every step of the way and demographically targeted to please every one ( and no one ) .	0
disney again ransacks its archives for a quick-buck sequel .	0
coarse , cliched and clunky , this trifling romantic comedy in which opposites attract for no better reason than that the screenplay demands it squanders the charms of stars hugh grant and sandra bullock .	0
anyone who suffers through this film deserves , at the very least , a big box of consolation candy .	0
how much you are moved by the emotional tumult of [françois and michèle's] relationship depends a lot on how interesting and likable you find them .	0
they presume their audience won't sit still for a sociology lesson , however entertainingly presented , so they trot out the conventional science-fiction elements of bug-eyed monsters and futuristic women in skimpy clothes .	0
collapses after 30 minutes into a slap-happy series of adolescent violence .	0
the following things are not at all entertaining : the bad sound , the lack of climax and , worst of all , watching seinfeld ( who is also one of the film's producers ) do everything he can to look like a good guy .	0
attal's hang-ups surrounding infidelity are so old-fashioned and , dare i say , outdated , it's a wonder that he couldn't have brought something fresher to the proceedings simply by accident .	0
obvious , obnoxious and didactic burlesque .	0
the most surprising thing about this film is that they are actually releasing it into theaters .	0
michele is a such a brainless flibbertigibbet that it's hard to take her spiritual quest at all seriously .	0
ultimately , clarity matters , both in breaking codes and making movies . enigma lacks it .	0
potty-mouthed enough for pg-13 , yet not as hilariously raunchy as south park , this strangely schizo cartoon seems suited neither to kids or adults .	0
. . . has its moments , but ultimately , its curmudgeon doesn't quite make the cut of being placed on any list of favorites .	0
a distinctly minor effort that will be seen to better advantage on cable , especially considering its barely feature-length running time of one hour .	0
most of the movie is so deadly dull that watching the proverbial paint dry would be a welcome improvement .	0
in the end , tuck everlasting falls victim to that everlasting conundrum experienced by every human who ever lived : too much to do , too little time to do it in .	0
rather less than the sum of its underventilated père-fils confrontations .	0
mckay shows crushingly little curiosity about , or is ill-equipped to examine , the interior lives of the characters in his film , much less incorporate them into his narrative .	0

a characteristically engorged and sloppy coming-of-age movie .	0
a somewhat disappointing and meandering saga .	0
whenever you think you've seen the end of the movie , we cut to a new scene , which also appears to be the end . but , no , we get another scene , and then another . you begin to long for the end credits as the desert does for rain .	0
an empty , ugly exercise in druggy trance-noir and trumped-up street credibility .	0
the screenplay , co-written by director imogen kimmel , lacks the wit necessary to fully exploit the comic elements of the premise , making the proceedings more bizarre than actually amusing .	0
the milieu is wholly unconvincing . . . and the histrionics reach a truly annoying pitch .	0
unfunny comedy with a lot of static set ups , not much camera movement , and most of the scenes take place indoors in formal settings with motionless characters .	0
each story is built on a potentially interesting idea , but the first two are ruined by amateurish writing and acting , while the third feels limited by its short running time .	0
except for paymer as the boss who ultimately expresses empathy for bartleby's pain , the performances are so stylized as to be drained of human emotion .	0

mattei so completely loses himself to the film's circular structure to ever offer any insightful discourse on , well , love in the time of money .	0
it briefly flirts with player masochism , but the point of real interest -– audience sadism -- is evaded completely .	0
holland lets things peter out midway , but it's notably better acted -- and far less crass - than some other recent efforts in the burgeoning genre of films about black urban professionals .	0
for every articulate player , such as skateboarder tony hawk or bmx rider mat hoffman , are about a half dozen young turks angling to see how many times they can work the words " radical " or " suck " into a sentence .	0
there's not a fresh idea at the core of this tale .	0
an impenetrable and insufferable ball of pseudo-philosophic twaddle .	0
it's unfortunate that wallace , who wrote gibson's braveheart as well as the recent pearl harbor , has such an irrepressible passion for sappy situations and dialogue .	0

[jackson and bledel] seem to have been picked not for their acting chops , but for their looks and appeal to the pre-teen crowd .	0
lillard and cardellini earn their scooby snacks , but not anyone else .	0
like schindler's list , the grey zone attempts to be grandiloquent , but ends up merely pretentious -- in a grisly sort of way .	0
an unremittingly ugly movie to look at , listen to , and think about , it is quite possibly the sturdiest example yet of why the dv revolution has cheapened the artistry of making a film .	0
[screenwriter] pimental took the farrelly brothers comedy and feminized it , but it is a rather poor imitation .	0
it's kind of sad that so many people put so much time and energy into this turkey .	0
friday after next is a lot more bluster than bite .	0
its juxtaposition of overwrought existentialism and stomach-churning gore will have you forever on the verge of either cracking up or throwing up .	0
a decidedly mixed bag .	0
meandering and confusing .	0

an empty shell of an epic rather than the real deal .	0

i'm sorry to say that this should seal the deal - arnold is not , nor will he be , back .	0
the story of trouble every day . . . is so sketchy it amounts to little more than preliminary notes for a science-fiction horror film , and the movie's fragmentary narrative style makes piecing the story together frustrating difficult .	0
a movie to forget	0

represents something very close to the nadir of the thriller/horror genre .	0
visually sumptuous but intellectually stultifying .	0
as a feature-length film , it wears out its welcome as tryingly as the title character .	0
a guilty pleasure at best , and not worth seeing unless you want to laugh at it .	0
a sleep-inducing thriller with a single twist that everyone except the characters in it can see coming a mile away .	0
with a " spy kids " sequel opening next week , why bother with a contemptible imitator starring a " snl " has-been acting like an 8-year-old channeling roberto benigni ?	0
it's just rather leaden and dull .	0

dismally dull sci-fi comedy .	0
there's surely something wrong with a comedy where the only belly laughs come from the selection of outtakes tacked onto the end credits .	0

the leads we are given here are simply too bland to be interesting .	0
[toback's] fondness for fancy split-screen , stuttering editing and pompous references to wittgenstein and kirkegaard . . . blends uneasily with the titillating material .	0
adam sandler's 8 crazy nights is 75 wasted minutes of sandler as the voice-over hero in columbia pictures' perverse idea of an animated holiday movie .	0
essentially " fatal attraction " remade for viewers who were in diapers when the original was released in 1987 . . . . this story gets sillier , not scarier , as it goes along . . .	0

strident and inelegant in its 'message-movie' posturing .	0
one regards reign of fire with awe . what a vast enterprise has been marshaled in the service of such a minute idea .	0
it has the right approach and the right opening premise , but it lacks the zest and it goes for a plot twist instead of trusting the material .	0
its impressive images of crematorium chimney fires and stacks of dead bodies are undermined by the movie's presentation , which is way too stagy .	0
seeing as the film lacks momentum and its position remains mostly undeterminable , the director's experiment is a successful one .	0
the plot is romantic comedy boilerplate from start to finish .	0
i suspect this is the kind of production that would have been funnier if the director had released the outtakes theatrically and used the film as a bonus feature on the dvd .	0

too bad writer-director adam rifkin situates it all in a plot as musty as one of the golden eagle's carpets .	0
it's lazy for a movie to avoid solving one problem by trying to distract us with the solution to another .	0
the movie is genial but never inspired , and little about it will stay with you .	0
the movie obviously seeks to re-create the excitement of such '50s flicks as jules verne's '20 , 000 leagues under the sea' and the george pal version of h . g . wells' 'the time machine . ' but its storytelling prowess and special effects are both listless .	0
despite the opulent lushness of every scene , the characters never seem to match the power of their surroundings .	0

watching " ending " is too often like looking over the outdated clothes and plastic knickknacks at your neighbor's garage sale . you can't believe anyone would really buy this stuff .	0
certainly beautiful to look at , but its not very informative about its titular character and no more challenging than your average television biopic .	0
it desperately wants to be a wacky , screwball comedy , but the most screwy thing here is how so many talented people were convinced to waste their time .	0
the skills of a calculus major at m . i . t . are required to balance all the formulaic equations in the long-winded heist comedy who is cletis tout ?	0

this latest installment of the horror film franchise that is apparently as invulnerable as its trademark villain has arrived for an incongruous summer playoff , demonstrating yet again that the era of the intelligent , well-made b movie is long gone .	0

the action quickly sinks into by-the-numbers territory .	0
forages for audience sympathy like a temperamental child begging for attention , giving audiences no reason to truly care for its decrepit freaks beyond the promise of a reprieve from their incessant whining .	0
when [reno] lets her radical flag fly , taking angry potshots at george w . bush , henry kissinger , larry king , et al . , reno devolves into a laugh-free lecture .	0

the ethos of the chelsea hotel may shape hawke's artistic aspirations , but he hasn't yet coordinated his own dv poetry with the beat he hears in his soul .	0
the sight of the name bruce willis brings to mind images of a violent battlefield action picture , but the film has a lot more on its mind--maybe too much .	0
why sit through a crummy , wannabe-hip crime comedy that refers incessantly to old movies , when you could just rent those movies instead , let alone seek out a respectable new one ?	0
the obnoxious special effects , the obligatory outbursts of flatulence and the incessant , so-five-minutes-ago pop music on the soundtrack overwhelm what is left of the scruffy , dopey old hanna-barbera charm .	0
exploring value choices is a worthwhile topic for a film -- but here the choices are as contrived and artificial as kerrigan's platinum-blonde hair .	0

to call this film a lump of coal would only be to flatter it .	0
entertainment more disposable than hanna-barbera's half-hour cartoons ever were .	0
the film falls short on tension , eloquence , spiritual challenge -- things that have made the original new testament stories so compelling for 20 centuries .	0
by the end of it all i sort of loved the people onscreen , even though i could not stand them . perhaps the film should be seen as a conversation starter . it's not an easy one to review .	0
at best this is a film for the under-7 crowd . but it would be better to wait for the video . and a very rainy day .	0
the whole talking-animal thing is grisly .	0
never again , while nothing special , is pleasant , diverting and modest -- definitely a step in the right direction .	0
wouldn't it be funny if a bunch of allied soldiers went undercover as women in a german factory during world war ii ? um , no . but here's a movie about it anyway .	0
has not so much been written as assembled , frankenstein-like , out of other , marginally better shoot-em-ups .	0
the punch lines that miss , unfortunately , outnumber the hits by three-to-one . but death to smoochy keeps firing until the bitter end .	0
mushes the college-friends genre ( the big chill ) together with the contrivances and overwrought emotion of soap operas .	0
showtime's starry cast could be both an asset and a detriment . those who trek to the 'plex predisposed to like it probably will enjoy themselves . but ticket-buyers with great expectations will wind up as glum as mr . de niro .	0
a determined , ennui-hobbled slog that really doesn't have much to say beyond the news flash that loneliness can make people act weird .	0
too daft by half . . . but supremely good natured .	0
fails in making this character understandable , in getting under her skin , in exploring motivation . . . well before the end , the film grows as dull as its characters , about whose fate it is hard to care .	0
it's a shame that the storyline and its underlying themes . . . finally seem so impersonal or even shallow .	0
woody , what happened ?	0
juliette binoche's sand is vivacious , but it's hard to sense that powerhouse of 19th-century prose behind her childlike smile .	0
it's supposed to be post-feminist breezy but ends up as tedious as the chatter of parrots raised on oprah .	0
you can tell almost immediately that welcome to collinwood isn't going to jell .	0
throughout all the tumult , a question comes to mind : so why is this so boring ?	0
cattaneo reworks the formula that made the full monty a smashing success . . . but neglects to add the magic that made it all work .	0
routine and rather silly .	0
a rip-off twice removed , modeled after [seagal's] earlier copycat under siege , sometimes referred to as die hard on a boat .	0
totally overwrought , deeply biased , and wholly designed to make you feel guilty about ignoring what the filmmakers clearly believe are the greatest musicians of all time .	0
you can practically hear george orwell turning over .	0
behan's memoir is great material for a film -- rowdy , brawny and lyrical in the best irish sense -- but sheridan has settled for a lugubrious romance .	0
while holm is terrific as both men and hjejle quite appealing , the film fails to make the most out of the intriguing premise .	0
lazy filmmaking , with the director taking a hands-off approach when he should have shaped the story to show us why it's compelling .	0
if it were any more of a turkey , it would gobble in dolby digital stereo . if nothing else , " rollerball " 2002 may go down in cinema history as the only movie ever in which the rest of the cast was outshined by ll cool j .	0
a movie that falls victim to frazzled wackiness and frayed satire .	0
how do you make a movie with depth about a man who lacked any ? on the evidence before us , the answer is clear : not easily and , in the end , not well enough .	0
the film's trailer also looked like crap , so crap is what i was expecting .	0
more trifle than triumph .	0
the movie is almost completely lacking in suspense , surprise and consistent emotional conviction .	0
festers in just such a dungpile that you'd swear you were watching monkeys flinging their feces at you .	0
lyne's latest , the erotic thriller unfaithful , further demonstrates just how far his storytelling skills have eroded .	0
it sounds like another clever if pointless excursion into the abyss , and that's more or less how it plays out .	0
rumor , a muddled drama about coming to terms with death , feels impersonal , almost generic .	0
report card : doesn't live up to the exalted tagline - there's definite room for improvement . doesn't deserve a passing grade ( even on a curve ) .	0
the pacing is deadly , the narration helps little and naipaul , a juicy writer , is negated .	0
as his circle of friends keeps getting smaller one of the characters in long time dead says 'i'm telling you , this is f * * * ed' . maybe he was reading the minds of the audience .	0
. . . if it had been only half-an-hour long or a tv special , the humor would have been fast and furious-- at ninety minutes , it drags .	0
bean drops the ball too many times . . . hoping the nifty premise will create enough interest to make up for an unfocused screenplay .	0
a well-acted , but one-note film .	0
blood work is laughable in the solemnity with which it tries to pump life into overworked elements from eastwood's dirty harry period .	0
the movie is too amateurishly square to make the most of its own ironic implications .	0
[lee] treats his audience the same way that jim brown treats his women -- as dumb , credulous , unassuming , subordinate subjects . and lee seems just as expectant of an adoring , wide-smiling reception .	0
there's not one decent performance from the cast and not one clever line of dialogue .	0
one of the worst movies of the year . . . . watching it was painful .	0
a era do gelo diverte , mas não convence . É um passatempo descompromissado – e só .	0
no amount of burning , blasting , stabbing , and shooting can hide a weak script .	0
it's an odd show , pregnant with moods , stillborn except as a harsh conceptual exercise .	0
nearly all the fundamentals you take for granted in most films are mishandled here .	0
the armenian genocide deserves a more engaged and honest treatment .	0
earnest yet curiously tepid and choppy recycling in which predictability is the only winner .	0
ultimately this is a frustrating patchwork : an uneasy marriage of louis begley's source novel ( about schmidt ) and an old payne screenplay .	0
the exploitative , clumsily staged violence overshadows everything , including most of the actors .	0

this is very much of a mixed bag , with enough negatives to outweigh the positives .	0
marinated in clichés and mawkish dialogue .	0
whether it's the worst movie of 2002 , i can't say for sure : memories of rollerball have faded , and i skipped country bears . but this new jangle of noise , mayhem and stupidity must be a serious contender for the title .	0
[a] boldly stroked , luridly coloured , uni-dimensional nonsense machine that strokes the eyeballs while it evaporates like so much crypt mist in the brain .	0
not once in the rush to save the day did i become very involved in the proceedings ; to me , it was just a matter of 'eh . '	0
rollerball is as bad as you think , and worse than you can imagine .	0
the first question to ask about bad company is why anthony hopkins is in it . we assume he had a bad run in the market or a costly divorce , because there is no earthly reason other than money why this distinguished actor would stoop so low .	0
not exaggerated enough to be a parody of gross-out flicks , college flicks , or even flicks in general . it merely indulges in the worst elements of all of them .	0
shame on writer/director vicente aranda for making a florid biopic about mad queens , obsessive relationships , and rampant adultery so dull .	0
suffers from a decided lack of creative storytelling .	0
violent , vulgar and forgettably entertaining .	0
nothing happens , and it happens to flat characters .	0
with a completely predictable plot , you'll swear that you've seen it all before , even if you've never come within a mile of the longest yard .	0
remember back when thrillers actually thrilled ? when the twist endings were actually surprising ? when the violence actually shocked ? when the heroes were actually under 40 ? sadly , as blood work proves , that was a long , long time ago .	0
blue crush has all the trappings of an energetic , extreme-sports adventure , but ends up more of a creaky " pretty woman " retread , with the emphasis on self-empowering schmaltz and big-wave surfing that gives pic its title an afterthought .	0
this movie plays like an extended dialogue exercise in retard 101 .	0
what we get in feardotcom is more like something from a bad clive barker movie . in other words , it's badder than bad .	0

a small independent film suffering from a severe case of hollywood-itis .	0
where the film falters is in its tone .	0
the story alone could force you to scratch a hole in your head .	0
ultimately , sarah's dedication to finding her husband seems more psychotic than romantic , and nothing in the movie makes a convincing case that one woman's broken heart outweighs all the loss we witness .	0
it's supposed to be a humorous , all-too-human look at how hope can breed a certain kind of madness -- and strength -- but it never quite adds up .	0
feels more like a rejected x-files episode than a credible account of a puzzling real-life happening .	0
some motion pictures portray ultimate passion ; others create ultimate thrills . men in black ii achieves ultimate insignificance -- it's the sci-fi comedy spectacle as whiffle-ball epic .	0
an enigmatic film that's too clever for its own good , it's a conundrum not worth solving .	0

certainly not a good movie , but it wasn't horrible either .	0
although it starts off so bad that you feel like running out screaming , it eventually works its way up to merely bad rather than painfully awful .	0
the result is so tame that even slightly wised-up kids would quickly change the channel .	0
it appears to have been modeled on the worst revenge-of-the-nerds clichés the filmmakers could dredge up .	0
nothing but an episode of smackdown ! in period costume and with a bigger budget .	0
it takes you somewhere you're not likely to have seen before , but beneath the exotic surface ( and exotic dancing ) it's surprisingly old-fashioned .	0
while the story is better-focused than the incomprehensible anne rice novel it's based upon , queen of the damned is a pointless , meandering celebration of the goth-vampire , tortured woe-is-me lifestyle .	0
it should be interesting , it should be poignant , it turns out to be affected and boring .	0
a good-looking but ultimately pointless political thriller with plenty of action and almost no substance .	0
a tired , predictable , bordering on offensive , waste of time , money and celluloid .	0
if hill isn't quite his generation's don siegel ( or robert aldrich ) , it's because there's no discernible feeling beneath the chest hair ; it's all bluster and cliché .	0
stealing harvard will dip into your wallet , swipe 90 minutes of your time , and offer you precisely this in recompense : a few early laughs scattered around a plot as thin as it is repetitious .	0
this is an insultingly inept and artificial examination of grief and its impacts upon the relationships of the survivors .	0
does anyone much think the central story of brendan behan is that he was a bisexual sweetheart before he took to drink ?	0
`martin lawrence live' is so self-pitying , i almost expected there to be a collection taken for the comedian at the end of the show .	0
the dialogue is cumbersome , the simpering soundtrack and editing more so .	0
never decides whether it wants to be a black comedy , drama , melodrama or some combination of the three .	0
it has become apparent that the franchise's best years are long past .	0
does what should seem impossible : it makes serial killer jeffrey dahmer boring .	0
don't hate el crimen del padre amaro because it's anti-catholic . hate it because it's lousy .	0
. . . better described as a ghost story gone badly awry .	0
like a bad improvisation exercise , the superficially written characters ramble on tediously about their lives , loves and the art they're struggling to create .	0
the filmmakers are playing to the big boys in new york and l . a . to that end , they mock the kind of folks they don't understand , ones they figure the power-lunchers don't care to understand , either .	0
competently directed but terminally cute drama .	0
the big finish is a bit like getting all excited about a chocolate eclair and then biting into it and finding the filling missing .	0
not just unlikable . disturbing . disgusting . without any redeeming value whatsoever .	0
this thing is virtually unwatchable .	0
those eternally devoted to the insanity of black will have an intermittently good time . feel free to go get popcorn whenever he's not onscreen .	0
the self-serious equilibrium makes its point too well ; a movie , like life , isn't much fun without the highs and lows .	0
the work of an exhausted , desiccated talent who can't get out of his own way .	0
the main characters are simply named the husband , the wife and the kidnapper , emphasizing the disappointingly generic nature of the entire effort .	0
in terms of execution this movie is careless and unfocused .	0
swims in mediocrity , sticking its head up for a breath of fresh air now and then .	0
the only type of lives this glossy comedy-drama resembles are ones in formulaic mainstream movies .	0
the characters . . . are paper-thin , and their personalities undergo radical changes when it suits the script .	0
a sha-na-na sketch punctuated with graphic violence .	0
the trouble is , its filmmakers run out of clever ideas and visual gags about halfway through .	0
spy-vs . -spy action flick with antonio banderas and lucy liu never comes together .	0
a so-so , made-for-tv something posing as a real movie .	0
the only upside to all of this unpleasantness is , given its labor day weekend upload , feardotcom should log a minimal number of hits .	0
whether this is art imitating life or life imitating art , it's an unhappy situation all around .	0
an uneasy mix of run-of-the-mill raunchy humor and seemingly sincere personal reflection .	0
a formula family tearjerker told with a heavy irish brogue . . . accentuating , rather than muting , the plot's saccharine thrust .	0
this is sandler running on empty , repeating what he's already done way too often .	0
this is as lax and limp a comedy as i've seen in a while , a meander through worn-out material .	0
time literally stops on a dime in the tries-so-hard-to-be-cool " clockstoppers , " but that doesn't mean it still won't feel like the longest 90 minutes of your movie-going life .	0
the sort of picture in which , whenever one of the characters has some serious soul searching to do , they go to a picture-perfect beach during sunset .	0
aptly named , this shimmering , beautifully costumed and filmed production doesn't work for me .	0
a preposterously melodramatic paean to gang-member teens in brooklyn circa 1958 .	0
has none of the crackle of " fatal attraction " , " 9 ½ weeks " , or even " indecent proposal " , and feels more like lyne's stolid remake of " lolita " .	0
everything its title implies , a standard-issue crime drama spat out from the tinseltown assembly line .	0
an extraordinarily silly thriller .	0
a rehash of every gangster movie from the past decade .	0
gaping plot holes sink this 'sub'-standard thriller and drag audience enthusiasm to crush depth .	0
talkiness isn't necessarily bad , but the dialogue frequently misses the mark .	0
the beautiful images and solemn words cannot disguise the slack complacency of [godard's] vision , any more than the gorgeous piano and strings on the soundtrack can drown out the tinny self-righteousness of his voice .	0
the stunt work is top-notch ; the dialogue and drama often food-spittingly funny .	0
the movie isn't painfully bad , something to be 'fully experienced' ; it's just tediously bad , something to be fully forgotten .	0
charly comes off as emotionally manipulative and sadly imitative of innumerable past love story derisions .	0
what a great shame that such a talented director as chen kaige has chosen to make his english-language debut with a film so poorly plotted and scripted .	0
no amount of good intentions is able to overcome the triviality of the story .	0
the film . . . presents classic moral-condundrum drama : what would you have done to survive ? the problem with the film is whether these ambitions , laudable in themselves , justify a theatrical simulation of the death camp of auschwitz ii-birkenau .	0
. . . for all its social and political potential , state property doesn't end up being very inspiring or insightful .	0
a film really has to be exceptional to justify a three hour running time , and this isn't .	0
little more than a stylish exercise in revisionism whose point . . . is no doubt true , but serves as a rather thin moral to such a knowing fable .	0
the nonstop artifice ultimately proves tiresome , with the surface histrionics failing to compensate for the paper-thin characterizations and facile situations .	0
this is a monumental achievement in practically every facet of inept filmmaking : joyless , idiotic , annoying , heavy-handed , visually atrocious , and often downright creepy .	0
this off-putting french romantic comedy is sure to test severely the indulgence of fans of amélie .	0
overburdened with complicated plotting and banal dialogue	0
ensemble movies , like soap operas , depend on empathy . if there ain't none , you have a problem .	0
the master of disguise falls under the category of 'should have been a sketch on saturday night live . '	0
yet another self-consciously overwritten story about a rag-tag bunch of would-be characters that team up for a can't-miss heist -- only to have it all go wrong .	0
koepp's screenplay isn't nearly surprising or clever enough to sustain a reasonable degree of suspense on its own .	0
is it really an advantage to invest such subtlety and warmth in an animatronic bear when the humans are acting like puppets ?	0
more successful at relating history than in creating an emotionally complex , dramatically satisfying heroine	0
clumsy , obvious , preposterous , the movie will likely set the cause of woman warriors back decades .	0
it's hard to pity the 'plain' girl who becomes a ravishing waif after applying a smear of lip-gloss . rather , pity anyone who sees this mishmash .	0
a banal , virulently unpleasant excuse for a romantic comedy .	0
the drama discloses almost nothing .	0
a minor-league soccer remake of the longest yard .	0
belongs in the too-hot-for-tv direct-to-video/dvd category , and this is why i have given it a one-star rating .	0
as earnest as a community-college advertisement , american chai is enough to make you put away the guitar , sell the amp , and apply to medical school .	0
a dim-witted and lazy spin-off of the animal planet documentary series , crocodile hunter is entertainment opportunism at its most glaring .	0
there is more than one joke about putting the toilet seat down . and that should tell you everything you need to know about all the queen's men .	0
even fans of ismail merchant's work , i suspect , would have a hard time sitting through this one .	0
it's really just another silly hollywood action film , one among a multitude of simple-minded , yahoo-ing death shows .	0
it's not a particularly good film , but neither is it a monsterous one .	0
the world needs more filmmakers with passionate enthusiasms like martin scorsese . but it doesn't need gangs of new york .	0
enchanted with low-life tragedy and liberally seasoned with emotional outbursts . . . what is sorely missing , however , is the edge of wild , lunatic invention that we associate with cage's best acting .	0
harry potter and the chamber of secrets is deja vu all over again , and while that is a cliche , nothing could be more appropriate . it's likely that whatever you thought of the first production -- pro or con -- you'll likely think of this one .	0
sade achieves the near-impossible : it turns the marquis de sade into a dullard .	0
[lin chung's] voice is rather unexceptional , even irritating ( at least to this western ear ) , making it awfully hard to buy the impetus for the complicated love triangle that develops between the three central characters .	0
one of the most plain , unimaginative romantic comedies i've ever seen .	0
though there's a clarity of purpose and even-handedness to the film's direction , the drama feels rigged and sluggish .	0
unfortunately , the experience of actually watching the movie is less compelling than the circumstances of its making .	0
unless there are zoning ordinances to protect your community from the dullest science fiction , impostor is opening today at a theater near you .	0
it should be doing a lot of things , but doesn't .	0
chen films the resolutely downbeat smokers only with every indulgent , indie trick in the book .	0
. . . a rather bland affair .	0
far-fetched premise , convoluted plot , and thematic mumbo jumbo about destiny and redemptive love .	0
the movie tries to be ethereal , but ends up seeming goofy .	0
i was hoping that it would be sleazy and fun , but it was neither .	0
harris is supposed to be the star of the story , but comes across as pretty dull and wooden .	0
soulless and -- even more damning -- virtually joyless , xxx achieves near virtuosity in its crapulence .	0
a boring masquerade ball where normally good actors , even kingsley , are made to look bad .	0
all the queen's men is a throwback war movie that fails on so many levels , it should pay reparations to viewers .	0
the filmmakers keep pushing the jokes at the expense of character until things fall apart .	0
rather than real figures , elling and kjell bjarne become symbolic characters whose actions are supposed to relate something about the naïf's encounter with the world .	0
mariah carey gives us another peek at some of the magic we saw in glitter here in wisegirls .	0
it's all arty and jazzy and people sit and stare and turn away from one another instead of talking and it's all about the silences and if you're into that , have at it .	0
i suspect that you'll be as bored watching morvern callar as the characters are in it . if you go , pack your knitting needles .	0
the lead actors share no chemistry or engaging charisma . we don't even like their characters .	0
some writer dude , i think his name was , uh , michael zaidan , was supposed to have like written the screenplay or something , but , dude , the only thing that i ever saw that was written down were the zeroes on my paycheck .	0
the movie doesn't generate a lot of energy . it is dark , brooding and slow , and takes its central idea way too seriously .	0
this feature is about as necessary as a hole in the head	0
the cinematic equivalent of patronizing a bar favored by pretentious , untalented artistes who enjoy moaning about their cruel fate .	0
spectators will indeed sit open-mouthed before the screen , not screaming but yawning .	0
it feels like very light errol morris , focusing on eccentricity but failing , ultimately , to make something bigger out of its scrapbook of oddballs .	0
a period story about a catholic boy who tries to help a jewish friend get into heaven by sending the audience straight to hell .	0
the premise itself is just sooooo tired . pair that with really poor comedic writing . . . and you've got a huge mess .	0
proves a lovely trifle that , unfortunately , is a little too in love with its own cuteness .	0
did we really need a remake of " charade ? "	0
some movies can get by without being funny simply by structuring the scenes as if they were jokes : a setup , delivery and payoff . stealing harvard can't even do that much . each scene immediately succumbs to gravity and plummets to earth .	0
the only fun part of the movie is playing the obvious game . you try to guess the order in which the kids in the house will be gored .	0
i spied with my little eye . . . a mediocre collection of cookie-cutter action scenes and occasionally inspired dialogue bits	0
entertains not so much because of its music or comic antics , but through the perverse pleasure of watching disney scrape the bottom of its own cracker barrel .	0
the satire is just too easy to be genuinely satisfying .	0
bearable . barely .	0
less funny than it should be and less funny than it thinks it is .	0
an " o bruin , where art thou ? " -style cross-country adventure . . . it has sporadic bursts of liveliness , some so-so slapstick and a few ear-pleasing songs on its soundtrack .	0
a feeble tootsie knockoff .	0
an awful movie that will only satisfy the most emotionally malleable of filmgoers .	0
…the story is far-flung , illogical , and plain stupid .	0
the very simple story seems too simple and the working out of the plot almost arbitrary .	0
an allegory concerning the chronically mixed signals african american professionals get about overachieving could be intriguing , but the supernatural trappings only obscure the message .	0
a very familiar tale , one that's been told by countless filmmakers about italian- , chinese- , irish- , latin- , indian- , russian- and other hyphenate american young men struggling to balance conflicting cultural messages .	0
one key problem with these ardently christian storylines is that there is never any question of how things will turn out .	0
essentially , the film is weak on detail and strong on personality	0
a relentless , bombastic and ultimately empty world war ii action flick .	0
[hell is] looking down at your watch and realizing serving sara isn't even halfway through .	0
too long , and larded with exposition , this somber cop drama ultimately feels as flat as the scruffy sands of its titular community .	0
leaves viewers out in the cold and undermines some phenomenal performances .	0
. . . a ho-hum affair , always watchable yet hardly memorable .	0
swiftly deteriorates into a terribly obvious melodrama and rough-hewn vanity project for lead actress andie macdowell .	0
the histrionic muse still eludes madonna and , playing a charmless witch , she is merely a charmless witch .	0
you have no affinity for most of the characters . nothing about them is attractive . what they see in each other also is difficult to fathom .	0
diaz , applegate , blair and posey are suitably kooky which should appeal to women and they strip down often enough to keep men alert , if not amused .	0
a technically well-made suspenser . . . but its abrupt drop in iq points as it races to the finish line proves simply too discouraging to let slide .	0
an inept , tedious spoof of '70s kung fu pictures , it contains almost enough chuckles for a three-minute sketch , and no more .	0
it's a mystery how the movie could be released in this condition .	0
absolutely ( and unintentionally ) terrifying .	0
eckstraordinarily lame and severely boring .	0
eight legged freaks falls flat as a spoof .	0
no matter how much he runs around and acts like a doofus , accepting a 50-year-old in the role is creepy in a michael jackson sort of way .	0
you'll just have your head in your hands wondering why lee's character didn't just go to a bank manager and save everyone the misery .	0
'dragonfly' dwells on crossing-over mumbo jumbo , manipulative sentimentality , and sappy dialogue .	0
in his determination to lighten the heavy subject matter , silberling also , to a certain extent , trivializes the movie with too many nervous gags and pratfalls .	0
blade ii has a brilliant director and charismatic star , but it suffers from rampant vampire devaluation .	0
veers uncomfortably close to pro-serb propaganda .	0
staggeringly dreadful romance .	0
movies like high crimes flog the dead horse of surprise as if it were an obligation . how about surprising us by trying something new ?	0
final verdict : you've seen it all before .	0
throwing in everything except someone pulling the pin from a grenade with his teeth , windtalkers seems to have ransacked every old world war ii movie for overly familiar material .	0
if a few good men told us that we " can't handle the truth " than high crimes poetically states at one point in this movie that we " don't care about the truth . "	0
further sad evidence that tom tykwer , director of the resonant and sense-spinning run lola run , has turned out to be a one-trick pony -- a maker of softheaded metaphysical claptrap .	0
you'll trudge out of the theater feeling as though you rode the zipper after eating a corn dog and an extra-large cotton candy .	0
the movie is a little tired ; maybe the original inspiration has run its course .	0
this will go on so long as there are moviegoers anxious to see strange young guys doing strange guy things .	0
a full-frontal attack on audience patience .	0
any intellectual arguments being made about the nature of god are framed in a drama so clumsy , there is a real danger less sophisticated audiences will mistake it for an endorsement of the very things that bean abhors .	0
it's a big idea , but the film itself is small and shriveled .	0
debut effort by " project greenlight " winner is sappy and amateurish .	0
one gets the impression the creators of don't ask don't tell laughed a hell of a lot at their own jokes . too bad none of it is funny .	0
the cast has a high time , but de broca has little enthusiasm for such antique pulp .	0
the film , like jimmy's routines , could use a few good laughs .	0
the film has too many spots where it's on slippery footing , but is acceptable entertainment for the entire family and one that's especially fit for the kiddies .	0
purports to be a hollywood satire but winds up as the kind of film that should be the target of something deeper and more engaging . oh , and more entertaining , too .	0
. . . in the pile of useless actioners from mtv schmucks who don't know how to tell a story for more than four minutes .	0

the film is strictly routine .	0
a real snooze .	0
skillful as he is , mr . shyamalan is undone by his pretensions .	0
while the new film is much more eye-catching than its blood-drenched stephen norrington-directed predecessor , the new script by the returning david s . goyer is much sillier .	0
in addition to sporting one of the worst titles in recent cinematic history , ballistic : ecks vs . sever also features terrible , banal dialogue ; convenient , hole-ridden plotting ; superficial characters and a rather dull , unimaginative car chase .	0
it shares the first two films' loose-jointed structure , but laugh-out-loud bits are few and far between .	0
the santa clause 2 is a barely adequate babysitter for older kids , but i've got to give it thumbs down .	0
you cannot guess why the cast and crew didn't sign a pact to burn the negative and the script and pretend the whole thing never existed .	0
barney throws away the goodwill the first half of his movie generates by orchestrating a finale that is impenetrable and dull .	0
if you're really renting this you're not interested in discretion in your entertainment choices , you're interested in anne geddes , john grisham , and thomas kincaid .	0
we get the comedy we settle for .	0
the uneven movie does have its charms and its funny moments but not quite enough of them .	0
two hours of sepia-tinted heavy metal images and surround sound effects of people moaning .	0
